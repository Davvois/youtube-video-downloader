# Youtube Video Downloader 

This is a small Python script that uses Tkinter and PyTube to download any YouTube video at max resolution. This is a replacement for those sketchy websites that you may find on the internet, I hope this founds out useful! :D

## Dependencies Installation

First of all, let's install Python3: if you're on Windows, install it from the Microsoft Store, instead, if you're on Linux, just execute this command in the terminal: 

```bash
sudo apt install python3
```

Once you've done that, execute this command just to make sure Python has installed correctly

```bash
python3 --version
```

If Python is installed correctly, clone this repository and install PyTube by executing this on your terminal:

```bash
pip install pytube
```

Once it's installed correctly, run the Python script and enjoy!
